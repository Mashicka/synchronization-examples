The @PostFilterannotation behaves mostly in the same way as the @PreFilterannotation, by filtering elements 
from a collection. 

The difference is that @PostFilterannotations are evaluated after the target method returns, 
and the SpEL expression in the annotation is evaluated against the returned collection from the target method. 
Note that I’m saying the “returned collection.” 

This is a condition required for the @PostFilterannotation to work. 
As with the @PreFilterannotation, it applies only to collections and arrays. If the return type is neither of these 
two, the DefaultMethodSecurityExpressionHandler(which is the one evaluating the expressions) will throw an 
IllegalArgumentException
